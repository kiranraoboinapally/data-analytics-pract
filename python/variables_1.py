#Varibales are like containers that stores/holds the data.
#Store information such as Integer,String,Float,Boolean.

#Key Concepts:
#1.Variable Assignment: Assigning a value to a variable is done with the = operator.
#2.Dynamic Typing: Python automatically determines the data type of a variable based on the value assigned.
#3.Naming Variables: Variables must start with a letter or an underscore and can contain letters, numbers, and underscores (but cannot start with a number).
